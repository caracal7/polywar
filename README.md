# Polywar

Polywar is an open-source top-down shooter game. It will have many different
weapon types, varying from fast, short range bullets to slow bombs that explode
on contact. It will be written entirely in JavaScript, with the server written
with Node.js and an HTML5 client that runs in modern web browsers.
